OpenSIPS (Open SIP Server) is a mature Open Source implementation of a SIP server. 

OpenSIPS is more than a SIP proxy/router as it includes application-level 
functionalities. OpenSIPS, as a SIP server, is the core component of any 
SIP-based VoIP solution. With a very flexible and customizable routing engine, 
OpenSIPS unifies voice, video, IM and presence services in a highly efficient way, 
thanks to its scalable (modular) design.

What OpenSIPS has to offer, comes in a reliable and high-performance flavour 
- OpenSIPS is one of the fastest SIP servers, with a throughput that confirms it 
as a solution up to enterprise or carrier-grade class.
